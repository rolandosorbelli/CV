# Rolando Sorbelli

I am a web developer (also a bit of designer for fun!) who has been playing around with coding and markup languages for a couple of years now. In these two years I achieved experience in languages like HTML, CSS, JQUERY and I am currently learning RUBY.

I am always looking for knowledge, I love learning new things everyday, especially when we are talking about coding and developing websites. I want to use my current experience (and the one I will achieve day by day) to rock the Boot Camp at Makers Academy!

## Personal skills ~

### attention to details

	I am fascinating by every little thing containing some kind of graphics or design, from a piece of furniture to a website. I love to pay attention to every small detail, even if it's just a dot, a hash or my beloved tilde ~ . I try everytime to make things look perfect.

### disposition to learn

	As I said already I am everyday ready to learn new things. I have always loved studying and even though sometimes I reach the point that my brain doesn't want anything else, I still don't give up. I love reading books and blogs, they always bring new knowledge!

### stress management

	That's one of my best quality I guess: I succeed in managing the strees almost everytime, or at least I try to! I have worked in busy places, especially in London and this gave me the chance to learn how to deal with stress, especially when you are working in a restaurant with 2 hours queue outside and hungry people raising their hands because they are ready to order.
