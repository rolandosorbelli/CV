I am a web developer who has been playing around with coding and markup languages for a couple of years now. I have gained experience in languages like HTML, CSS, jQuery and I am currently learning Ruby and JavaScript.

I am currently looking for a job as Front-End Developer and I would like to develop my skills using JavaScript and React.

## Personal skills ~

**attention to detail**

- I am fascinated by every little thing that has some kind of graphics or design element to it, whether it is a piece of furniture or a website. I love to pay attention to every small detail, even if it's just a dot, a hash or my beloved tilde ~. During my internship at The Web Kitchen I was assisting the team in creating or mantaining websites for our clients and I was continuosly reviewing my work to make sure I never missed something.

**willing to learn**

- I am a person who loves learning new things every day. I have always loved studying and reading and when I have some free time I like to keep myself updated on new techologies by reading blogs.

**stress management**

- I always try to prioritise my work so I can easily manage the stress around a deadline or a task that I am working on. For sure the experience that I gained working in a busy place like Dishoom, a restaurant in Central London where I worked for almost 4 years, helped me to achieve this skill and I find it helpful when it comes to work under preassure.
